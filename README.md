# Step01: Specify the research goal & requirements
What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
> This project will support the users to easily and accurately track the real-time location of their family members or loved ones. This would help users feel more connected and provide them with peace of mind knowing the whereabouts of their family members. Additionally, the app could include features such as check-ins, messaging, and emergency alerts to further enhance the user experience and provide even more value to the users.

What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
> The basic need/goal involved in tracking the real-time location of family members or loved ones is to ensure their safety and well-being. By knowing where their loved ones are at all times, users can feel more secure and confident in their ability to respond to any potential emergencies or situations that may arise. The app can also help families coordinate activities, stay connected, and improve their communication. Ultimately, the goal is to provide peace of mind to users and help them feel more connected with their loved ones.

What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
>Traditionally, people have used a variety of methods to keep track of their loved ones' whereabouts, including phone calls, text messages, and in-person check-ins.
> Currently, there are several apps available in the market that offer similar functionality to Life360. These include Glympse, Find My, and Google Maps. These apps use GPS technology to track the location of a user's phone and allow them to share their location with other users. Some of these apps may also offer additional features such as messaging, check-ins, and emergency alerts.
> Previously, Zenly was the most popular location-sharing app. However, it has recently permanently closed down.

What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
> User Preferences: Your target users are likely to value privacy, accuracy, and ease of use. They may also prefer an app with a simple and intuitive user interface that is not overwhelming. Additionally, they may prefer an app that allows them to customize the level of sharing and control over their location information.
> Expertise: Your target users are likely to be comfortable using mobile apps and technology in general. They may have a moderate to high level of tech-savviness and an understanding of how to use location tracking apps. However, your app should also be designed to be easy enough to use for users with limited tech experience.
