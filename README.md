# DH110 Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry
## Yongsen Huang - DH110 Spring 2023

# Step01: Specify the research goal & requirements
What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
> This project will support the users to easily and accurately track the real-time location of their family members or loved ones. This would help users feel more connected and provide them with peace of mind knowing the whereabouts of their family members. Additionally, the app could include features such as check-ins, messaging, and emergency alerts to further enhance the user experience and provide even more value to the users.

What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
> The basic need/goal involved in tracking the real-time location of family members or loved ones is to ensure their safety and well-being. By knowing where their loved ones are at all times, users can feel more secure and confident in their ability to respond to any potential emergencies or situations that may arise. The app can also help families coordinate activities, stay connected, and improve their communication. Ultimately, the goal is to provide peace of mind to users and help them feel more connected with their loved ones.

What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
>Traditionally, people have used a variety of methods to keep track of their loved ones' whereabouts, including phone calls, text messages, and in-person check-ins.
> Currently, there are several apps available in the market that offer similar functionality to Life360. These include Glympse, Find My, and Google Maps. These apps use GPS technology to track the location of a user's phone and allow them to share their location with other users. Some of these apps may also offer additional features such as messaging, check-ins, and emergency alerts.
> Previously, Zenly was the most popular location-sharing app. However, it has recently permanently closed down.

What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
> User Preferences: Your target users are likely to value privacy, accuracy, and ease of use. They may also prefer an app with a simple and intuitive user interface that is not overwhelming. Additionally, they may prefer an app that allows them to customize the level of sharing and control over their location information.
> Expertise: Your target users are likely to be comfortable using mobile apps and technology in general. They may have a moderate to high level of tech-savviness and an understanding of how to use location tracking apps. However, your app should also be designed to be easy enough to use for users with limited tech experience.

# Step02: Target users
What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)
> Demographics: The primary target users for your app are likely to be families or groups of friends who want to stay connected and keep track of each other's whereabouts. Your target audience may include parents who want to monitor their children, or friends who are coordinating meetups or road trips. The app is suitable for children above 10 years old and elders above 60 years old, making it applicable to all age groups.
> User Preferences: Your target users are likely to value privacy, accuracy, and ease of use. They may also prefer an app with a simple and intuitive user interface that is not overwhelming. Additionally, they may prefer an app that allows them to customize the level of sharing and control over their location information.
> Expertise: Your target users are likely to be comfortable using mobile apps and technology in general. They may have a moderate to high level of tech-savviness and an understanding of how to use location tracking apps. However, your app should also be designed to be easy enough to use for users with limited tech experience.

In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?
>Safety: People use location tracking apps primarily for safety reasons. Parents track their children when they're out with friends or going to and from school. Friends use the app to coordinate meetups or ensure safe arrival at destinations.
>Coordination: The app can be used for coordination, such as planning road trips, tracking progress, and ensuring punctuality for events or appointments.
>Emergencies: The app can be used to locate and communicate with loved ones during natural disasters or accidents. For example, in an earthquake, family members can use the app to quickly find each other and ensure everyone is safe.

What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
> In order to ensure the accuracy of the location information, users may need to enable the app to access their device's GPS, as well as ensure that their loved ones have the app installed and have given permission to share their location. Users may also need to keep their device charged and connected to the internet to ensure real-time updates.

# Step03: Pick an qualitative research method
1. Observation
> I will conduct a overt observation. As my target users won't have any physical needs from my app, I will only observe how they check on their loved ones regularly and how they want to improve their experience.
2. Background questions
> It's important to consider their demographic information, such as age, income, and education level. Additionally, their family conditions, such as marital status and number of children, can also play a role in their purchasing decisions. By understanding these factors, I can tailor my app to better meet the needs of my target users. 
3. Interaction
> I will conduct a participatory interaction with a friend who fits my target demographic details. I will ask them to complete user activities for me and share their experience.

# Insights from the Interview

### What motivates you to use a location tracking app? [2:57]
> There have been a few different reasons why I have used location tracking apps in the past when one reason is for navigation purposes. When I am in an unfamiliar area or trying to find the best route to a new location, using a location tracking app, like Google Maps, or Waze can be very helpful in providing directions and helping me avoid traffic or road closures are the reasons I have. Use location checking apps for safety and security. For example, when meeting up with friends or family members in a crowded area, using an app like Find My Friends can help us quickly locate each other and ensure that everyone is safe. Finally, I have also use location tracking apps for work related purposes. Such as tracking the location of deliveries or coordinating with team members who are in different locations.

### Can you describe any features or functionalities that you wish your current location app has? [11:15]
> Definitely Battery Saver on all the map apps are battery intensive, which can be a problem for some users. A location checking app that manages battery life better or has power saving modes will be a valuable feature.

### How did you find the process of tracking your loved one's location using the app. [16:19]
> The process is pretty easy and so far I think that if the app is easy to use and provides accurate location data locate check. Checking a loved one's location using the app should be a straightforward and effective process.

# Reflection
It was a pleasant experience working with my partner during this interview. Throughout the tasks, my partner demonstrated a strong ability to follow instructions and successfully find the designated locations. I was glad to learn that my partner is an experienced location tracking app user.
One observation I made is that people often compare location tracking apps based on their usability and available features. It is crucial to maintain information security and provide a clear user interface. Additionally, location tracking apps tend to consume a high amount of battery which may inconvenience users.
I learned a lot from my friend and obtained valuable feedback on how to improve the app design. However, I realized that I could have asked more follow-up questions during the interview to gather more information from the interviewee. My partner and I rehearsed once and improved the script before the final recording.
